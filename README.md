### Hi! I'm Kyle Olsen and I'm a Software Developer ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on client websites, a volunteer project called SupUnity, and a personal project called Tandemly that will be used to remember date ideas for me and my girlfriend.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™ve just started learning some C++ in the hopes of coding small electronics here in the near future. I would love to develop my own IoT devices.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on just about anything! My main expertise is in web development using React.js and Node.js, but I love learning anything and everything and would be excited to work with a team on any project.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Feel free to reach out to me on either [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyle-olsen-dev/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KyleDev222). I'm open to new job opportunities!

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him

- âš¡ Fun fact: Before becoming a software developer, I worked as an orchestral musician playing the bassoon!
